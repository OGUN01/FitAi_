## ðŸ“ž SUPPORT INFO

**Files Implemented:**
- `src/types/onboarding.ts` - Type definitions âœ…
- `src/services/validationEngine.ts` - Core validation âœ…
- `src/utils/healthCalculations.ts` - Calculations âœ…
- `src/screens/onboarding/tabs/*.tsx` - UI tabs âœ…
- `src/components/onboarding/*.tsx` - Validation UI components âœ…

**Key Concepts:**
- TDEE = baseTDEE (from occupation) + exerciseBurn (from MET values)
- Warnings only run if no blocking errors (per spec)
- Body fat priority: user > AI > BMI > default
- Medical adjustments: most impactful only, no stacking, 15% cap
- stress_level affects deficit limits and timeline adjustments
