🚨 STEP 2: VALIDATION SCENARIOS & WARNINGS
CRITICAL ERRORS (Must Fix Before Proceeding)
❌ SCENARIO 1: Target Below BMR
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: Calculated daily calories < BMR

Example:
  BMR: 1835 cal/day
  Calculated target: 1102 cal/day
  
Error Message:
  "⚠️ UNSAFE CALORIE TARGET
  Your target of 1102 calories is below your Basal Metabolic Rate (1835 cal).
  Eating below BMR can cause:
  - Muscle loss
  - Metabolic slowdown
  - Hormonal imbalances
  - Fatigue and weakness
  
  RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ✅ Extend your timeline from 16 weeks to 26 weeks
  ✅ Increase workout frequency to burn more calories
  ✅ Accept a slower, healthier weight loss rate (0.5-0.7kg/week)"

Action Required: User MUST adjust timeline or goals
❌ SCENARIO 2: Unrealistic Timeline
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: Required weekly loss > 1% body weight

Example:
  Current: 88kg, Target: 70kg (18kg loss)
  Timeline: 16 weeks
  Required: 1.125 kg/week (1.28% body weight)
  
Error Message:
  "⚠️ UNREALISTIC TIMELINE
  To lose 18kg in 16 weeks requires losing 1.125kg/week.
  This is too aggressive and can cause:
  - Significant muscle loss
  - Metabolic adaptation
  - Nutrient deficiencies
  - Loose skin
  - Rebound weight gain
  
  Safe rate: 0.5-1% body weight/week (0.44-0.88 kg/week for you)
  
  RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ✅ Extend timeline to 26 weeks (0.7kg/week - OPTIMAL)
  ✅ Or adjust target to 77kg in 16 weeks (0.69kg/week - SAFE)"

Action Required: User MUST adjust timeline or target weight
❌ SCENARIO 3: Insufficient Workout Frequency
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: workout_frequency_per_week < 2 AND aggressive goals

Example:
  Goal: Lose 10kg in 12 weeks
  Workout frequency: 1x/week
  
Error Message:
  "⚠️ INSUFFICIENT EXERCISE
  Your goal requires a significant calorie deficit, but you're only
  planning to exercise 1x/week. This means:
  - Very low daily calorie intake required
  - Higher muscle loss risk
  - Slower metabolism
  
  RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ✅ Increase to at least 3 workouts/week (adds ~900 cal/week burn)
  ✅ Or extend timeline to reduce required deficit
  ✅ Add daily walking (10,000 steps = ~300 cal/day)"

Action Required: Increase exercise or adjust timeline
❌ SCENARIO 4: Muscle Gain with High Deficit
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: primary_goals includes "muscle-gain" BUT in calorie deficit

Example:
  Goals: Muscle gain + Weight loss
  Calculated: 25% calorie deficit
  
Error Message:
  "⚠️ CONFLICTING GOALS
  You selected 'Muscle Gain' but your weight loss goal requires a
  calorie deficit. Building significant muscle requires a surplus.
  
  Your options:
  
  Option 1: BODY RECOMPOSITION (Slow but possible)
    - Eat at maintenance calories
    - High protein (2.4g/kg)
    - Progressive strength training
    - Expect: Slow fat loss + small muscle gains
    - Best for: Beginners, returning lifters
    
  Option 2: PRIORITIZE FAT LOSS FIRST
    - Stay in deficit with high protein
    - Strength train to preserve muscle
    - Build muscle later in surplus phase
    - Timeline: 6 months cut → 3 months bulk
    
  Option 3: ADJUST EXPECTATIONS
    - Accept slower weight loss
    - Smaller deficit (10-15%)
    - Focus on strength gains
  
  Which approach do you prefer?"

Action Required: User must choose strategy
❌ SCENARIO 5: Pregnancy/Breastfeeding with Deficit
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: pregnancy_status OR breastfeeding_status = true AND deficit

Error Message:
  "🚫 UNSAFE FOR PREGNANCY/BREASTFEEDING
  Weight loss during pregnancy or breastfeeding is NOT recommended.
  
  Your body needs EXTRA calories for:
  - Fetal development (pregnancy)
  - Milk production (breastfeeding: +500 cal/day)
  - Your own health and recovery
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  ✅ Switch to maintenance or slight surplus
  ✅ Focus on nutrient-dense foods
  ✅ Gentle exercise only (walking, prenatal yoga)
  ✅ Consult your doctor before any diet changes"

Action Required: BLOCK deficit, force maintenance/surplus
❌ SCENARIO 6: Medical Conditions Requiring Supervision
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: medical_conditions includes diabetes, hypertension, PCOS, thyroid

Warning Message:
  "⚠️ MEDICAL CONDITION DETECTED
  You indicated: [Diabetes Type 2]
  
  Important considerations:
  - Carbohydrate timing and quantity matter
  - Blood sugar monitoring required
  - Medication may need adjustment
  - Risk of hypoglycemia with exercise
  
  RECOMMENDATIONS:

  ✅ Monitor blood glucose regularly
  ✅ Adjust insulin/medication as needed
  
  We'll adjust your plan, but medical supervision is essential."

Action Required: Show disclaimer, adjust macros
WARNINGS (Can Proceed but Should Consider)
⚠️ SCENARIO 7: Low Sleep Duration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: sleep_duration < 7 hours

Warning:
  "⚠️ INSUFFICIENT SLEEP
  You're sleeping only 5.5 hours/night. Optimal is 7-9 hours.
  
  Impact on your goals:
  - 40% slower fat loss
  - Increased hunger hormones (ghrelin)
  - Decreased satiety hormones (leptin)
  - Poor recovery from workouts
  - Increased cortisol (belly fat storage)
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  ✅ Prioritize sleep improvement
  ✅ We've adjusted your expected timeline by 20%
  ✅ Consider sleep hygiene tips in our guide"

Action: Adjust timeline expectations, show sleep tips
⚠️ SCENARIO 8: High Alcohol Consumption
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: alcohol_consumption = "frequent" OR "moderate"

Warning:
  "⚠️ ALCOHOL IMPACT ON GOALS
  Frequent alcohol consumption affects your results:
  
  - Empty calories (7 cal/gram, no nutrition)
  - Impaired fat burning (liver prioritizes alcohol)
  - Reduced muscle protein synthesis
  - Poor sleep quality
  - Dehydration
  
  Example: 3 beers/week = ~450 calories = 0.06kg/week slower loss
  
  RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ✅ Limit to 1-2 drinks/week maximum
  ✅ Choose lower-calorie options (vodka soda vs beer)
  ✅ Account for alcohol calories in daily budget
  ✅ Never drink on workout days"

Action: Add alcohol calories to budget, adjust timeline
⚠️ SCENARIO 9: High Stress Levels
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: stress_level = "high"

Warning:
  "⚠️ HIGH STRESS DETECTED
  Chronic stress significantly impacts fat loss:
  
  - Elevated cortisol → belly fat storage
  - Increased cravings (especially sugar)
  - Poor sleep quality
  - Reduced workout performance
  - Slower recovery
  
  RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ✅ Include stress management (meditation, yoga)
  ✅ Prioritize sleep even more
  ✅ Consider adaptogens (ashwagandha)
  ✅ Avoid aggressive deficits (increases cortisol)
  ✅ We've reduced your deficit by 5% to account for this"

Action: Reduce deficit slightly, add stress management tips
⚠️ SCENARIO 10: Tobacco Usage
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: tobacco_usage = true

Warning:
  "⚠️ TOBACCO IMPACT ON FITNESS
  Smoking/tobacco use severely impacts your goals:
  
  - Reduced VO2 max (cardio capacity)

  ✅ Focus on breathing exercises
  ✅ Increase antioxidant intake (vitamins C, E)"

Action: Adjust exercise intensity, show quit resources
⚠️ SCENARIO 11: Very Low Workout Experience
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: workout_experience_years = 0 AND intensity = "advanced"

Warning:
  "⚠️ EXPERIENCE MISMATCH
  You're new to exercise but selected advanced intensity.
  
  Risks:
  - High injury risk
  - Burnout and quitting
  - Poor form and technique
  - Excessive soreness
  
  RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ✅ Start with beginner intensity (auto-adjusted)
  ✅ Focus on form over weight
  ✅ Include rest days
  ✅ Progress gradually (10% increase/week)
  ✅ Consider working with a trainer initially"

Action: Override intensity to beginner, show progression plan
OPTIMIZATIONS (Suggestions to Improve Results)
💡 SCENARIO 12: Intermittent Fasting Opportunity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: intermittent_fasting = false AND struggling with adherence

Suggestion:
  "💡 CONSIDER INTERMITTENT FASTING
  Based on your schedule and preferences, IF might help:
  
  Benefits for you:
  - Easier to maintain calorie deficit
  - Improved insulin sensitivity
  - Better adherence (fewer meals to plan)
  - Fits your late wake time (10 AM)
  
  Suggested protocol: 16:8
  - Eating window: 12 PM - 8 PM
  - Fasting window: 8 PM - 12 PM next day
  - Aligns with your workout time (afternoon)
  
  Would you like to try this?"

Action: Offer IF as optional enhancement
💡 SCENARIO 13: Refeed Day Recommendation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: timeline > 12 weeks AND aggressive deficit

Suggestion:
  "💡 REFEED DAYS RECOMMENDED
  Your plan involves a long diet phase (26 weeks).
  
  Benefits of weekly refeeds:
  - Boost leptin (metabolism hormone)
  - Restore glycogen for better workouts
  - Mental break from dieting
  - Improved long-term adherence
  - May actually speed up fat loss
  
  Recommendation:
  - Every Saturday: Eat at maintenance
  - Increase carbs by 150g
  - Keep protein same
  - Reduce fat slightly
  
  This is included in your plan automatically."

Action: Add refeed days to plan
💡 SCENARIO 14: Supplement Recommendations
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: Based on diet type, goals, deficiencies

Suggestion for Vegan:
  "💡 SUPPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
  As a vegan, consider these supplements:
  
  Essential:
  - Vitamin B12 (1000 mcg/day) - Not in plant foods
  - Vitamin D3 (2000 IU/day) - Limited sun exposure
  - Omega-3 (algae-based EPA/DHA) - Brain & heart health
  
  Beneficial:
  - Iron (if low energy) - Plant iron less bioavailable
  - Zinc (15mg/day) - Immune function
  - Creatine (5g/day) - Muscle performance
  
  For muscle gain:
  - Vegan protein powder (pea/rice blend)
  
  These are optional but may improve results."

Action: Show personalized supplement list
💡 SCENARIO 15: Workout Timing Optimization
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Condition: preferred_workout_times vs meal timing

Suggestion:
  "💡 OPTIMIZE WORKOUT TIMING
  You prefer evening workouts (6-8 PM).
  
  Recommendations:
  - Pre-workout meal: 4-5 PM (carbs + protein)
  - Post-workout meal: 8-9 PM (protein + carbs)
  - This maximizes performance and recovery
  
  Sample pre-workout: Banana + protein shake
  Sample post-workout: Chicken + rice + veggies
  
  We've adjusted your meal timing in the plan."

Action: Optimize meal timing in nutrition plan
