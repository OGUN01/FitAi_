# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Plan & Review
Before starting work
Write a plan to .claude/tasks/TASK_NAME.md.

The plan should be a detailed implementation plan and the reasoning behind them, as well as tasks broken down.

Don't over plan it, always think MVP.

Once you write the plan, firstly ask me to review it. Do not continue until I approve the plan.

## While implementing

You should update the plan as you work.

After you complete tasks in the plan, you should update and append detailed descriptions of the changes you made, so following tasks can be easily hand over to other engineers.

## Project Overview

FitAI is an AI-powered fitness companion mobile app built with React Native (Expo), TypeScript, and Supabase backend. It integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for 100% personalized workout and nutrition content generation with ZERO generic data.

### Revolutionary AI Approach
- **100% Personalized Content**: Every workout and meal is uniquely generated for each user
- **Zero Generic Data**: No "Bench Press, Burpees, Deadlift" placeholders - all content is AI-created
- **Experience Intelligence**: 1-2 weeks of content based on user's experience level
- **Structured Output**: Fixed JSON parsing with proper `responseMimeType` configuration

- `src/utils/` - Testing and validation utilities
  - `testExerciseMatching.ts` - Comprehensive testing suite

### Critical Patterns

1. **AI Integration**: ALWAYS use Google's official structured output API for ALL LLM responses (see `src/ai/schemas/`)
   - CRITICAL: Use `responseMimeType: "application/json"` with `responseSchema`
   - Always create fresh model instance for structured output
   - MANDATORY: Use `JSON.parse(response.text())` to convert JSON string to object
   - NEVER use plain text responses or custom JSON cleaning
   - ALL AI responses must follow defined schemas in `src/ai/schemas/`
2. **100% Personalization**: Never use generic data - everything must be AI-generated
   - Database tables (exercises, foods) should be empty of generic content
   - All content driven by user's onboarding data
3. **Weekly Content Generation**: Use experience-level based planning
   - Beginner: 1 week (3 workouts)
   - Intermediate: 1.5 weeks (5 workouts)
   - Advanced: 2 weeks (6 workouts)
4. **State Management**: Use Zustand stores, not React Context
5. **Offline Support**: Utilize `offlineStore` for data persistence
6. **Authentication**: Handle through `authStore` and `src/services/auth.ts`
7. **Type Safety**: All components and functions must have proper TypeScript types
8. **Visual Exercise System**: Always use advanced matching for 100% coverage
   - Use `exerciseVisualService.preloadWorkoutVisuals()` for instant performance
   - Leverage multi-tier matching system for intelligent exercise mapping  
   - Display tier indicators (üéØüîçüß†üìÇ‚ö°) for match quality feedback
   - Implement performance metrics display for premium user experience

### Recently Fixed Issues ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Netflix-Level Performance - <100ms response times with advanced matching
- ‚úÖ Professional Visual Experience - Tier indicators and performance metrics

### Database Schema (15 Tables)
- **Core Tables**: user_profiles, fitness_goals, diet_preferences, workout_preferences, body_analysis
- **Content Tables**: exercises (AI-only), foods (AI-only), workouts, meals
- **AI Content Tables**: nutrition_goals, meal_logs (NEW)
- **Tracking Tables**: workout_sessions, progress_entries

### Environment Setup
- Uses EAS for builds and deployments
- Environment variables managed through `eas.json`
- Supabase keys in environment variables (never commit these)

When making changes:
1. Always run type-check before committing
2. Follow existing component patterns in the codebase
3. Update tests for any logic changes
4. Use the established service layer for API calls
5. Maintain the atomic design structure for components

## Google Sign-In Setup

Google Sign-In is fully implemented and ready to use. To enable it:

1. **Follow the setup guide**: See `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md` for complete instructions
2. **Get OAuth credentials**: Set up Google Cloud Console project and download config files
3. **Configure Supabase**: Enable Google provider in your Supabase Auth settings
4. **Set environment variables**: Add Google Client IDs to EAS configuration
5. **Add config files**: Place `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` in project root

### Quick Setup Checklist:

## AI Implementation Guidelines

### LLM Output Rules - MANDATORY FOR ALL AI RESPONSES

**RULE #1: STRUCTURED OUTPUT ONLY**
- Every single AI response MUST use Google's official structured output API
- NEVER use plain text responses for any data generation
- ALL responses must have corresponding schemas in `src/ai/schemas/`

**RULE #2: OFFICIAL API CONFIGURATION**
- Always use `responseMimeType: "application/json"` 
- Always provide `responseSchema` parameter
- Create fresh model instance for each structured call

**RULE #3: GOOGLE OFFICIAL STRUCTURED OUTPUT ONLY**
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Use Google's official structured output API for 100% accuracy
- Always use `responseMimeType: "application/json"` with `responseSchema`  
- Google returns JSON as STRING via `response.text()` - parse with `JSON.parse()`
- üö® **NEVER** manually prompt AI to "generate JSON" - use schema only
- JSON.parse() is REQUIRED for Google's structured output and allowed for AsyncStorage, database, cache

**RULE #4: SCHEMA COMPLIANCE**
- Every schema must be in OpenAPI 3.0 format with proper typing
- Required properties must be marked as `required: [....]`
- Use proper enum values for controlled vocabularies

**RULE #5: ERROR HANDLING**
- Wrap JSON.parse in try-catch blocks
- Retry on parse failures with exponential backoff
- Log raw response on parsing errors for debugging

### Gemini Structured Output (CRITICAL)
```typescript
// CORRECT: Always create fresh model instance for structured output
const modelInstance = genAI!.getGenerativeModel({
  model: MODEL_NAME,
  generationConfig: {
    responseMimeType: "application/json",  // CRITICAL
    responseSchema: schema,
    temperature: 0.7,
    maxOutputTokens: 8192
  }
});

// STRUCTURED OUTPUT: Returns object directly - NO PARSING NEEDED
const response = await modelInstance.generateContent(prompt);
const data = response.text(); // Returns structured object directly - NOT a string!
```

### Weekly Content Generation Pattern
```typescript
// Use aiService.generateWeeklyWorkoutPlan() not individual workouts
const response = await aiService.generateWeeklyWorkoutPlan(
  personalInfo,
  fitnessGoals,
  weekNumber
);

// Plan duration based on experience:
// - Beginner: 3 workouts over 1 week
// - Intermediate: 5 workouts over 1.5 weeks
// - Advanced: 6 workouts over 2 weeks
```

### Zero Generic Content Rule
- NEVER display generic exercises like "Bench Press, Burpees"
- NEVER populate database with sample workout data
- All content must be generated from user's specific onboarding data
- Empty database tables are correct - they get filled with AI content

### Macro Calculation
```typescript
// Use Mifflin-St Jeor equation for calorie calculation
const bmr = gender === 'male' 
  ? 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age + 5
  : 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age - 161;

// Apply activity multiplier and goal adjustment
const tdee = bmr * activityMultiplier;
const targetCalories = goal === 'weight_loss' ? tdee * 0.85 : tdee;
```
